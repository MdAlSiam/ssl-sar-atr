improvement plan after 3-sample-fitting.ipy

# Augmentation and Preprocess
> brightness adjustments, scaling, translation, segmentation [u-net, classical methods], flipping, zooming, color jittering
> tools like tf.image provide various augmentation functions that can be chained together
> * adding class weight in downstream task
> use techniques like t-SNE or PCA to visualize the extracted features and understand their separability
> * using contrastive learning methods like SimCLR or BYOL for feature extraction (have shown great results in self-supervised learning)

# Pretext
> trying more advanced architectures or residual connections to improve feature learning

# Downstream
> * experiment with different layers for feature extraction to identify which provides the most useful representations (facing graph disconnection issue while trying to extraxct features from functional layers in pretrained architectures)
