1. Top Performing Architectures
InceptionV3 and ResNet50 consistently outperform others, especially with GradBoost and XGBoost classifiers:

InceptionV3 + XGBoost: Accuracy of 78.8 ± 5.2% with F1-score of 76.9 ± 6.1%.
InceptionV3 + GradBoost: Accuracy of 78.5 ± 6.2%, slightly behind XGBoost.
ResNet50 + XGBoost: Accuracy of 69.6 ± 4.3%.
ResNet152 shows promising results but has higher variability across splits, particularly for Random Forest and GradBoost, suggesting sensitivity to data distribution.

2. Best Classifiers
XGBoost and GradBoost generally yield higher accuracy and F1-scores compared to RandomForest and SVM across most architectures.

XGBoost consistently achieves better results for InceptionV3 and ResNet architectures.
GradBoost performs competitively but lags slightly behind XGBoost in certain cases.
SVM performs poorly for most architectures, with significant variability and lower scores. It's not well-suited for this task, possibly due to the nature of the feature space.

3. Variability Across Splits
The standard deviation for accuracy and F1-scores is higher for certain architecture-classifier combinations, particularly:
EfficientNetB0 + SVM: High variability (Accuracy: 61.4 ± 24.0%).
ResNet152 + Random Forest: Significant drop in one split, reducing overall consistency (Accuracy: 65.9 ± 15.8%).
This variability suggests potential overfitting or sensitivity to certain splits.
4. Trends Across Architectures
Shallow Architectures (CNN): Lower overall performance, with XGBoost achieving the best results among classifiers.
Deeper Architectures (ResNet, InceptionV3): Higher scores overall, indicating better feature extraction capabilities.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Perform hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost and GradBoost on InceptionV3 and ResNet50 to further optimize results.
Tune learning rates, tree depths, and regularization parameters for better generalization.
5. Explore Semi-Supervised Learning
Incorporate semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques for improving performance, especially for architectures with higher variability.
Techniques like pseudo-labeling or self-training could enhance performance on low-performing splits.
6. Visual Analysis
Generate confusion matrices and ROC curves for the best-performing combinations to evaluate detailed class-wise performance.
7. Consider Ensemble Learning
Combine predictions from the top-performing classifiers (e.g., GradBoost and XGBoost) for a more robust solution.
8. Explore Transfer Learning
Fine-tune InceptionV3 and ResNet models with pre-trained weights on the specific dataset to leverage domain knowledge.
